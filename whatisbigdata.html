        <h2>Big Data Fundamentals – Conceptual Base</h2>

 <section class="section">
    <h3>Introduction – Expert View (Industry Motivation)</h3>
    <p class="desc">
        I started my career working extensively with traditional relational databases such as MySQL, Oracle, and
        PostgreSQL. For many years, this approach worked well — the data was structured, volumes were manageable,
        and scaling meant upgrading hardware or tuning indexes.
    </p>

    <p class="desc">
        The turning point came when I worked on a project that started ingesting massive amounts of user activity
        logs, clickstreams, and sensor data. Data was arriving continuously, in different formats, and at a speed
        that traditional database systems were never designed to handle. Queries became slow, storage costs
        increased rapidly, and schema changes became painful.
    </p>

    <p class="desc">
        At that stage, I realized that the problem was not my SQL skills or database tuning — it was the <b>design
        itself</b>. Traditional databases assume limited data volume, fixed schema, and centralized processing.
        Big Data systems, on the other hand, assume <b>failures are normal, data is distributed, and scale is
        unpredictable</b>.
    </p>

    <p class="desc">
        This forced a complete shift in the way I designed systems: data had to be partitioned instead of stored
        in one place, computation had to move closer to the data, and fault tolerance had to be built into the
        system by default. These design changes led me to Big Data technologies such as Hadoop and Spark.
    </p>

    <div class="tip">
        <b>Why this matters:</b> Big Data is not just a new toolset — it represents a fundamental change in how
        software systems are designed when data becomes too large, too fast, and too diverse for traditional
        databases.
    </div>

    <div class="exam">

        and variety of modern data.

    <h3>Big Data and Data Science – An Industry Perspective</h3>

    <p class="desc">
        During my early years as a software engineer, data analysis largely meant running SQL queries and generating
        reports from well-structured databases. Data Science, as we understand it today, was not feasible at scale
        because the data was limited, clean, and centrally stored.
    </p>

    <p class="desc">
        The relationship between Big Data and Data Science became clear when projects started generating massive
        volumes of raw, unstructured, and continuously arriving data. Traditional analytics could not extract
        meaningful insights fast enough. Data Science required not only algorithms and statistics, but also
        platforms capable of storing and processing data at scale.
    </p>

    <p class="desc">
        Big Data provides the <b>infrastructure foundation</b> for Data Science. Technologies like HDFS, Spark, and
        distributed data lakes make it possible to collect raw data first and apply transformations, feature
        engineering, and model training later. This approach enables experimentation, reproducibility, and scalable
        analytics.
    </p>

    <p class="desc">
        In real-world systems, a Data Science workflow typically begins with Big Data ingestion, followed by data
        cleaning, aggregation, and feature extraction. Only after this Big Data processing stage can machine
        learning models be trained, evaluated, and deployed effectively.
    </p>

    <div class="tip">
        <b>AI/ML Context:</b> Data Science models are only as good as the data feeding them. Big Data platforms ensure
        sufficient data volume, variety, and processing power to build accurate and reliable models.

                Big Data refers to datasets that are too large, too fast, or too complex to be handled efficiently by
                traditional database systems. It requires distributed storage and parallel processing.

    <h3>Quick Quiz – Check Your Understanding (Click to Reveal)</h3>

    <details>
        <summary>1️⃣ Which Big Data characteristic explains why data arrives continuously from IoT devices?</summary>
        <p>Velocity.</p>
    </details>

    <details>
        <summary>2️⃣ Why do traditional RDBMS systems struggle with unstructured data like images and logs?</summary>
        <p>
            Traditional RDBMS systems require a fixed schema and are optimized for structured tables, making them
            inefficient for storing and processing unstructured data.
        </p>
    </details>

    <details>
        <summary>3️⃣ In a real project, why is data first stored in a data lake instead of being immediately structured?</summary>
        <p>
            Because Big Data systems follow a schema-on-read approach, allowing flexible analysis and experimentation
            before deciding the structure.
        </p>
    </details>

    <details>
        <summary>4️⃣ How does Big Data enable Data Science workflows?</summary>
        <p>
            Big Data platforms provide scalable storage and parallel processing, enabling data cleaning, feature
            engineering, and model training on large datasets.
        </p>
    </details>

    <details>
        <summary>5️⃣ Why is fault tolerance considered a design requirement in Big Data systems?</summary>
        <p>
            Because failures are expected in distributed environments, and Big Data systems must continue operating
            without data loss.
        </p>
    </details>

    <details>
        <summary>6️⃣ Which of the 5 V’s directly impacts the accuracy of machine learning models?</summary>
        <p>
            Veracity, because poor data quality leads to unreliable model predictions.
        </p>
    </details>

    <details>
        <summary>7️⃣ Why is scaling vertically not a preferred solution for Big Data?</summary>
        <p>
            Vertical scaling is expensive and has hardware limits, while Big Data systems are designed for horizontal
            scaling using commodity hardware.
        </p>
    </details>

    <details>
        <summary>8️⃣ In Big Data design, why is computation moved closer to the data?</summary>
        <p>
            To reduce network overhead and improve performance by minimizing data movement.
