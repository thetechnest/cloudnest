                orchestration facilities. These Hypervisors powers IaaS service delivery models.
                2. Multitenancy: Multitenancy is when several different cloud customers are accessing the same computing
                resources, such as when several different companies are storing data on the same physical server.

            Every public cloud provide several interfaces for Cloud management:

            Cloud Consumption is subject to professional expertise and consultation. There is lot of jargon like cloud
            management, provisioning and more. To give you the glimpse here is example.
            <br>
            When you adopt Cloud for Business. first thing comes provisioning of cloud resources, then configuring and
            managing cloud users access control so that other team can only access what they need to support in routine
            business support2, Integration with other services on same cloud or other provides or sometimes with onprem

            and billing, setting up budgets, managing security and privacy of cloud resources and many more other
            administrative and Architecture knowledge required in order to fully benefit from the cloud services.

                Cloud security follows the shared responsibility model which clearly separates provider
                and consumer responsibilities.
            </p>
            <br>
            If you are IaaS Consumer:<br>
            Provider's Responsibility:<br>

            Provider is responsible for managing(updating, upgrade and patching) a Hardware(CPU, Storage and
            Connectivity) and Hypervisor. Provider is responsible for securing the infra below the Operation system(OS
            not included).<br>

            Consumer's Responsibility:<br>

            In IaaS, Consumer has complete Control over the Operating system. Consumer is responsible for securing the
            OS(deploying security patches, update and upgrades).<br>

            <br>
            <br>
            If you are PaaS Consumer:<br>
            Provider's Responsibility:<br>

            Cloud Provider is responsible securing the infra below and up to the OS (os included) level.<br>

            Consumer's Responsibility:<br>

            Consumer's responsibility is configure, install software packages or running software on the os. Consumer
            need to follow the security and privacy guidelines and best practices recommended by the provide. <br>
            <br>
            <br>If you are SaaS Consumer:<br>
            Provider's Responsibility:<br>

            Service provider is responsible for managing all the underlying infra of the service. it also responsible
            for security and privacy from external bad actors excluding security vulnerabilities subject to creep due to
            lose configuration and customizations.<br>

            Consumer's Responsibility:<br>

            Saas Consumers are responsible for provisioning the service, configuring and making customizations to get
            personalized consumer experience. even though consumer is not responsible for managing vulnerabilities
            creeps due the underlying infra but It strongly recommended to make sure that consumer must understand the
            vulnerabilities creep or security and privacy risk which comes due to loose configuration and customizations
            in the service. Consumer must have plan to mitigate these security and privacy threats.<br>

        <!-- BROKER -->
        <section class="section">
            <h3>Cloud Broker</h3>
            <br>Cloud Broker is a company or individual who act as intermediary between the cloud provider and consumer.
            Sometime Cloud provide is invisible to the cloud Consumer.

            <br>Cloud Brokerage firm can be setup in one of 3 ways.

            <br>Intermediation: A cloud broker enhances a given service by improving some specific capability and
            providing value-added services to cloud consumers. The improvement can be managing access to cloud services,
            identity management, performance reporting, enhanced security, etc.
            <br>Aggregation: A cloud broker combines and integrates multiple services into one or more new services. The
            broker provides data integration and ensures the secure data movement between the cloud consumer and
            multiple cloud providers. For Example: SaaS solution like Salesforce, ServiceNOW and Netflix OTT platform.
            Cloud Marketplaces on AWS, Azure and GCP are also used for providing Cloud Aggregated Services.
            <br>Arbitrage: Service arbitrage is similar to service aggregation except that the services being aggregated
            are not fixed. Service arbitrage means a broker has the flexibility to choose services from multiple
            agencies. The cloud broker, for example, can use a credit-scoring service to measure and select an agency
            with the best score.<br>
            <ul>
                <li>Intermediation</li>
                <li>Aggregation</li>

                with the intent to express an opinion thereon. Audits are performed to verify conformance to standards
                through review of objective evidence. A cloud auditor can evaluate the services provided by a cloud
                provider in terms of security controls, privacy impact, performance, etc<br>
