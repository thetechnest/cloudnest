<h2>Shared Responsibility Model & NIST Cloud Reference Model – My Project Experience (The BIG Picture)</h2>

<!-- INTRO -->
<section class="section">
    <h3>Why Shared Responsibility Matters in Real Projects</h3>
    <p class="desc">
        When organizations move to the cloud, one of the most misunderstood concepts
        is the <b>Shared Responsibility Model</b>. Many assume that once workloads are
        moved to cloud, the cloud provider takes care of everything.
    </p>
    <p class="desc">
        Through my project on Google Cloud Platform (GCP), I clearly understood that
        cloud success depends on how well responsibilities are shared between
        the provider and the customer.

        In addition to the cloud provider and cloud consumer roles, the
        <b>NIST Cloud Reference Model</b> also defines two important roles:
        <b>Cloud Auditor</b> and <b>Cloud Broker</b>.
        In my project, these roles played a crucial part in governance,

        The cloud auditor is responsible for independently assessing cloud services

    <h3>Billing and Cost Optimization – Managing Cloud Spend Responsibly</h3>

        One of the most critical responsibilities of a cloud customer is
        <b>cost management</b>. Cloud platforms provide flexibility and scalability,
        but without proper billing controls, costs can quickly go out of control.

<!-- PRACTICAL SLA & SLO IMPLEMENTATION -->
<section class="section">
    <h3>Practical Implementation of SLA and SLO on GCP – Real Operational Insight</h3>

    <p class="desc">
        Understanding SLA and SLO definitions is important, but their real value
        comes from how they are practically implemented and monitored.
        In my project on Google Cloud Platform (GCP), SLA and SLO tracking
        was tightly integrated with monitoring and alerting systems.
    </p>

    <!-- SLA PRACTICAL -->
    <h4 style="font-family:Poppins;">1. How SLAs Were Practically Used and Monitored</h4>
    <p class="desc">
        SLAs on GCP are provided at the service level (for example,
        compute, storage, networking, and managed services).
        As a customer, I did not configure SLAs directly,
        but I actively monitored them to ensure compliance.
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>Reviewed official GCP SLA documentation for each critical service</li>
        <li>Mapped GCP SLAs to project dependencies and risk areas</li>
        <li>Monitored service uptime using Cloud Monitoring dashboards</li>
        <li>Tracked service disruptions and maintenance notifications</li>
        <li>Verified SLA breaches and eligibility for service credits</li>
    </ul>

    <div class="exam">
        📘 Exam Insight: Cloud SLAs are predefined by the provider and verified through monitoring data.
    </div>

    <!-- SLO PRACTICAL -->
    <h4 style="font-family:Poppins;">2. How SLOs Were Defined in the Project</h4>
    <p class="desc">
        SLOs were defined based on business expectations rather than
        cloud provider guarantees. We focused on metrics that directly
        impacted end-user experience.
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>Defined availability SLOs (for example, 99.9% service uptime)</li>
        <li>Defined latency SLOs for API response times</li>
        <li>Defined error-rate SLOs for failed requests</li>
        <li>Aligned SLOs with customer-facing service expectations</li>
    </ul>

    <div class="tip">
        <b>SRE Insight:</b> Good SLOs are based on user experience, not system internals.
    </div>

    <!-- SLO MONITORING -->
    <h4 style="font-family:Poppins;">3. Monitoring and Tracking SLOs on GCP</h4>
    <p class="desc">
        Once SLOs were defined, they were continuously monitored
        using GCP’s native observability tools.
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>Created custom metrics using Cloud Monitoring</li>
        <li>Built SLO dashboards to visualize compliance in real time</li>
        <li>Configured alerts when SLO thresholds were at risk</li>
        <li>Used historical data to analyze trends and reliability</li>
    </ul>

    <!-- ERROR BUDGET -->
    <h4 style="font-family:Poppins;">4. Error Budgets and Operational Decisions</h4>
    <p class="desc">
        Error budgets were used to make practical engineering decisions.
        When the system was well within SLO targets, teams focused on
        feature development. When error budgets were consumed,
        reliability improvements were prioritized.
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>Paused risky deployments during reliability degradation</li>
        <li>Focused on bug fixes and performance tuning</li>

<!-- SLA BREACH SCENARIO -->
<section class="section">
    <h3>SLA Breach Scenario – Learning from a Realistic Cloud Incident</h3>

    <p class="desc">
        To truly understand the importance of SLAs, students must see what happens
        when an SLA is not met. In my project, we encountered a situation where
        a cloud service did not fully meet its committed SLA, and this became
        a valuable learning experience for both the customer and the cloud provider.
    </p>

    <!-- INCIDENT -->
    <h4 style="font-family:Poppins;">1. The Incident – Storage SLA Not Met</h4>
    <p class="desc">
        The issue occurred with a cloud storage service that was used as an
        asynchronous data exchange layer between microservices.
        During a specific time window, the storage service experienced
        higher-than-expected latency and partial unavailability in a region.
    </p>

    <p class="desc">
        Although the issue was temporary, it impacted downstream services
        that depended on timely access to stored data.
    </p>

    <div class="exam">
        📘 Exam Insight: Even managed cloud services can experience temporary disruptions.
    </div>

    <!-- IDENTIFICATION -->
    <h4 style="font-family:Poppins;">2. How the SLA Breach Was Identified</h4>
    <p class="desc">
        The SLA breach was not identified manually. It was detected through
        continuous monitoring and alerting mechanisms already in place.
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>Cloud Monitoring alerts triggered due to increased latency</li>
        <li>Error rates crossed defined SLO thresholds</li>
        <li>Logs showed delayed storage read/write operations</li>
        <li>Provider status dashboard confirmed a regional service issue</li>
    </ul>

    <div class="tip">
        <b>Operational Lesson:</b> SLA breaches are detected through metrics, not assumptions.
    </div>

    <!-- REPORTING -->
    <h4 style="font-family:Poppins;">3. Reporting and SLA Credit Process</h4>
    <p class="desc">
        Once the issue was confirmed and correlated with the provider’s
        incident report, we evaluated whether the outage violated
        the published SLA terms.
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>Reviewed official GCP SLA documentation for the affected service</li>
        <li>Matched outage duration against SLA thresholds</li>
        <li>Collected monitoring evidence and incident timelines</li>
        <li>Submitted an SLA credit request through billing support</li>
    </ul>

    <p class="desc">
        After validation, service credits were applied to the project’s
        billing account, reducing the overall cloud cost for that billing cycle.
    </p>

    <div class="exam">
        📘 Exam Line: SLA credits compensate customers when provider commitments are not met.
    </div>

    <!-- MITIGATION -->
    <h4 style="font-family:Poppins;">4. How We Mitigated the Impact</h4>
    <p class="desc">
        While SLA credits addressed the financial impact, our primary focus
        was ensuring business continuity and improving system resilience.
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>Implemented retry and backoff mechanisms for storage access</li>
        <li>Added temporary caching to reduce direct dependency</li>
        <li>Improved alert thresholds for earlier detection</li>
        <li>Reviewed architecture for regional fault tolerance</li>
    </ul>

    <div class="tip">
        <b>Architect Insight:</b> SLA credits reduce cost impact,
        but architecture changes reduce business impact.
    </div>

    <!-- REALIZATION -->
    <h4 style="font-family:Poppins;">5. Key Realization for Students</h4>
    <p class="desc">
        This incident clearly demonstrated why SLAs matter to both
        cloud providers and customers. For providers, SLAs enforce
        accountability and transparency. For customers, SLAs provide
        measurable guarantees and financial protection.
    </p>

    <p class="desc">
        More importantly, this experience reinforced that SLAs do not
        replace good architecture. They complement it.
