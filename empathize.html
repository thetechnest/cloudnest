    <!-- WHAT IS EMPATHIZE -->
    <section class="section">
        <h3>What is Empathize?</h3>
        <p class="desc">
            Empathize is the first and most critical stage of Design Thinking. It focuses on
            understanding users deeply by observing, interacting, and listening to them.
            Instead of assuming problems, designers try to experience the users’ emotions,
            challenges, and expectations.
        </p>

        <div class="highlight">
            🎯 In Design Thinking, empathy means <b>designing with users, not for users</b>.

    <!-- WHY EMPATHY MATTERS -->
    <section class="section">
        <h3>Why Empathy Matters to a Software Designer</h3>
        <p class="desc">
            Software designers often focus on features and technology. However, without empathy,
            even technically perfect software can fail to satisfy users.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Helps designers understand real user pain points</li>
            <li>Prevents building unnecessary or confusing features</li>
            <li>Improves usability, trust, and user satisfaction</li>
            <li>Aligns software behavior with human emotions</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Understanding Students of NBKRIST (Project Context)</h3>
        <p class="desc">
            In the ResultPulse project, empathy was focused on understanding the academic and
            emotional challenges faced by NBKRIST students during result declaration.
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>Fear and anxiety while checking results</li>
            <li>Confusion due to marks-only presentation</li>
            <li>Inability to identify strengths and weaknesses</li>

            The empathy stage was conducted using multiple qualitative methods to capture
            real student experiences.
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>Informal discussions with students after result declaration</li>
            <li>Observation of student reactions during result days</li>

    <h3>Empathy Interview – Scripted Interaction</h3>

    <p class="desc">
        To understand students’ real experiences beyond assumptions, a scripted empathy interview
        was conducted. The goal was not to judge performance, but to listen carefully and
        capture emotional and cognitive challenges faced during result declaration.

        <b>System Designer(Shankar):</b> How do you usually feel when results are released?
        <br><br>
        <b>NBKRIST Student(Peter):</b> Honestly, I feel very anxious. Even before opening the result,
        I worry about how much I scored and how others performed.

    <div class="desc">
        <b>System Designer(Shankar):</b> What is the biggest difficulty you face after seeing your marks?

        <b>System Designer(Shankar):</b> Do the current result systems help you plan your improvement?
        <br><br>
        <b>NBKRIST Student(Peter):</b> Not really. I usually wait for faculty guidance because the
        result itself doesn’t explain anything.

    <section class="section">
        <h3>Outcome of the Empathize Stage</h3>
        <p class="desc">
            The empathy stage revealed that the core issue was not poor performance,
            but poor interpretation of performance. Students needed clarity,
            reassurance, and actionable insights rather than just marks.
